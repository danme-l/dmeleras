                What you're looking at right now is v1. Currently, this is all completely static html & css, interspersed with bits of JavaScript here and there.
                There are multiple html files and ample code is reused between them, and this could have been written in the days before YouTube and Facebook,
                let alone the days before React and Flask. It is a website that <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/javascript-trap.html">Richard Stallman would be proud of.</a><br><br>
                Whenever I can find the time, I'm working on a new version using React, which I'm hoping I can make fairly dynamic, with actual useful 
                applications that someone may actually want to visit a website for. <br><br>
