Personal website version 1!

First version of a personal website created in basic HTML, CSS, JS for hobby programming/learning. It's got links to projects I've been working on through [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) and [free code camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/).

Planning on adding some Data Science and Engineering Projects in the (near) future.

A more modern version of this using React (+hopefully full MERN stack) is in the works ever so slowly.
